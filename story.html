      <p class="story-paragraph">One day, I was walking through the woods, when a bear suddenly appeared in front of me.  I ran away, but the bear chased me. <i>Grandma</i> came out and beat the bear with a cane. Then,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter" target="_blank">Harry Potter</a> appeared and used a blasting spell to blow up North America. I died and woke up inside another dream. Inside the dream, I was eaten by another bear. I made the bear throw me up and ran away. When I got home, I got my grandma to come with me to attack the bear and kill it. We were so sad with what we’d done that we started running through <a href="http://coasterbuzz.com/CoasterPhoto/CoasterPhotoImage/2973" target="_blank">Six Flags</a> carrying the bear. My woes were with me.  After that, I rode on the <span class="red"> Raging Bull</span>. Then I was thrown out of the park. I became an emo that day.</p>

      <p class="story-paragraph">I transformed into a centaur. Then I ran into the distance, galloping with 82<sup>926384fsw</sup> princesses on my back. It was glorious. We rode into the sunset. Only after I had passed into darkness did I realize that I was actually a chicken. I walked six miles not knowing where I was going. I then realized I was sitting in McDonald’s.I got really sad so I decided to go to the lake. That’s when I saw it: <b>The Sharknado!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</b> I got swallowed by the sharknado. Then I woke up in cold H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>
