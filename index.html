    <h2 class="red">This is Part I</h2>
    
    <p>One day, I was walking through the woods, when a bear suddenly appeared in front of me.  I ran away, but the bear chased me. <i>Grandma</i> came out and beat the bear with a cane. Then, Harry Potter appeared and used a blasting spell to blow up North America. I died and woke up inside another dream. Inside the dream, I was eaten by another bear. I made the bear throw me up and ran away. When I got home, I got my grandma to come with me to attack the bear and kill it. We were so sad with what we’d done that we started running through Six Flags carrying the bear. My woes were with me.  After that, I rode on the Raging Bull. Then I was thrown out of the park. I became an emo that day.</p>
    
    <h2 class="orange">This is Part II</h2>
    <p class="orange">I transformed into a centaur. Then I ran into the distance, galloping with 82<sup>926384fsw</sup> princesses on my back. It was glorious. We rode into the sunset. Only after I had passed into darkness did I realize that I was actually a chicken. I walked six miles not knowing where I was going. I then realized I was sitting in McDonald’s.I got really sad so I decided to go to the lake. That’s when I saw it: <b>The Sharknado!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</b> I got swallowed by the sharknado. Then I woke up in cold H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>
